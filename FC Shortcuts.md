# Overview

This document provides an overview of my keyboard shortcuts used in FreeCAD, specifically tailored for my French AZERTY keyboard layout. The shortcuts are designed to be easily accessible with the left hand, allowing for efficient workflow in the PartDesign workbench.

Having commonly used functions easily accessible with the left hand is crucial for a smooth workflow in FreeCAD. The following shortcuts are designed to minimize the need to stretch fingers or move hands away from the home row.

You should:
1. first list the available keys on your keyboard, taking into account:
   - the keys that are easily accessible with your left hand (if your're using the mouse or trackball with the right hand), 
   - your national keyboard layout, 
   - the letters already used as keyboard shortcuts (there are few in PartDesign, unlike in Sketcher where there are many).

2. then list your most used function

3. try to map them to the available keys, and that's not easy!
 
# Available keys 

Keys easily accessible with the **left** hand on my French AZERTY keyboard:

1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6
--|---|---|---|---|---  
A | Z | **E** | R | **T** 
Q | S | **D** | **F** | G | **H**
W | X | **C** | V | B | N

Column 1 to 5 are preffered.  
Mapped keys are in **bold** (make it easier to see what is still available)


# Most used functions and associated Shortcuts

As there is collision and unavailable keys, finding an easy to remember mapping is not easy. 
For example, on my keyboard the 'p' is on the extreme right side of the keyboard, and so not available for **P**rotrusion, or **P**ocket. 

Here is my choice:

Key | Description | WorkBench | Function
:--:|-------------|-----------|---------
F   | **F**illet / _Chanfrein_ | PartDesign | Chamfer
D   | _**D**essin_  | PartDesign | NewSketch
E   | **E**xtrusion | PartDesign | Protrusion
C   | _**C**reuse_ / Pocket | PartDesign | Pocket
H   | **H**ole / _Perçage_ | PartDesign | Hole
T   | **T**hickness | PartDesign | Thickness

(French words in italic)

# Settings shortcuts in FreeCAD

- English : tools -> customize
- French : outils -> personnaliser  

Choose the Category "PartDesign" and then the command you want to change.
When choosing a shortcut, functions already assigned to that key are shown in the right panel. If it's used in another Workbench, no problem, there is no collision : you can assign the same key to different functions in different workbenches, so you can have a shortcut for **E**xtrusion in PartDesign and another for **E**xtrude in Draft, for example.

[Deltahedra video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKq7hgbu7ks&t=300s) is realy a good investment, because he is not only explaining shortcuts, but also how to use macros, how to get rid of that default interface, far too complex, which scares off all new users, and how to easily setup a really nice and simple UI.  
All those info are available in other ressources, but this one is the most effective I found so far (13" first minutes).
